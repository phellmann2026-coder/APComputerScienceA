//Question 1: The difference between a class and an object is that a class is the blueprint from which the object will be made. For example, you create Car class to build a car later as an object. 
//Question 2: When you pass an object to a print or println method java converts the object to a string before printing. 
//Question 3: The scope of a variable in a method is only within that method, or local. The scope of a variable in a class applies throughoutthe class and is accessible by all methods in that class.
